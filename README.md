# Local-HTML-file-browser

The application will load all your HTML files and you should be able to view them by selecting 1 and then clicking the down arrow.
It also supports CSS and some basic JS if you ever decide to add that.

I have provided instructions on how to use below.
The download link is [here][1] or is located in the bin>release folder.
The full src code can be found on this Github.

First Click File>Open Directory

You should be presented with a window like this.
If the window appears to be cut off at the bottom, you may have to move the window up or resize it to be smaller.

Navigate to the folder in which all your HTML files are stored. And then click "Ok".
Since you are loading over 1000 HTML files this may take a little while to load. Please allow for a couple of minutes while all the files are being loaded.

Once it is done all your files should appear on the panel to the left side.

While the scroll bar appears to be going sideways, I assure you that the down arrow will still work.

Clicking on a file on the left panel will load it on the right side for your viewing. Pressing down arrow will automatically load the next file. If you ever wish to view the code then you can see it by pressing the "Toggle Code / Browser" button at the top.
